Aardonyx	Early Jurassic	Herbivore	Saurischia	8	aardonyx.jpg	Aardonyx would have been largely bipedal (walking on 2 legs) but also capable of walking on all 4 legs. This and its way of feeding are transitional features between those of basal sauropodomorphs and the more derived sauropods (large dinosaurs that walked on all fours) that came later.	South Africa
Abelisaurus	Late Cretaceous	Carnivore	Saurischia	9	abelisaurus.jpg	Abelisaurus was a bipedal carnivore that probably reached 7 to 9 meters (23 to 30 feet) in length, although it is known from only one partial skull.	Argentina
Achelousaurus	Late Cretaceous	Herbivore	Ornithischia	6	achelousaurus.jpg	Achelousaurus were quadrupedal herbivores with parrot-like beaks, rough bosses (raised bony areas) on their snouts and one pair behind their eyes, and a pair of horns on the end of their long bony frills.

Achillobator	Late Cretaceous	Carnivore	Saurischia	5	achillobator.jpg	Achillobator was a moderately-built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore. It would have been an active predator, hunting with the enlarged, sickle-shaped claw on the second toe.	Mongolia
Acrocanthosaurus	Late Cretaceous	Carnivore	Saurischia	12	acrocanthosaurus.jpg	Acrocanthosaurus was a bipedal predator. As the name suggests, it is best known for the high neural spines on many of its vertebrae, which most likely supported a ridge of muscle over the animal's neck, back and hips.	Canada, USA
Aegyptosaurus	Early Cretaceous	Herbivore	Saurischia	15	aegyptosaurus.jpg	Aegyptosaurus fossils have been found in Egypt, Niger and in several different locations in the Sahara Desert.

The fossils were stored together in Munich, but were obliterated when an Allied bombing raid destroyed the museum where they were kept in 1944, during World War II.	Egypt
Afrovenator	Early Cretaceous	Carnivore	Saurischia	9	afrovenator.jpg	The generic name comes from the Latin afer, "African", and venator, "hunter". There is one named species, Afrovenator abakensis. The generic name refers to its predatory nature, and its provenance from Africa. The specific name refers to Abaka, the Tuareg name for the region of Niger where the fossil was found.	Niger
Agilisaurus	Late Jurassic	Herbivore	Ornithischia	2	agilisaurus.jpg	A single complete skeleton of A. louderbacki is known to science, one of the most complete small ornithischian skeletons ever found.

Anchisaurus	Early Jurassic	Herbivore	Saurischia	2	anchisaurus.jpg	Sauropodomorph remains were first discovered in North America in 1818, when some large bones were discovered by Mr. Solomon Ellsworth while excavating a well in East Windsor, Connecticut. At the time of their discovery the bones were assumed to be those of a human, but the presence of tail bones quickly falsified that idea and they are now recognized as those of an indeterminate sauropodomorph, possibly more closely related to the plateosaurian prosauropods.	USA
Ankylosaurus	Late Cretaceous	Herbivire	Ornithischia	7	ankylosaurus.jpg	One of the largest armoured dinosaurus, Ankylosaurus had a wide, heavily armoured skull and a large tail club. It had a large gut space for digesting plant material.	Canada, USA

Antarctosaurus	Late Cretaceous	Herbivore	Saurischia	18	antarctosaurus.jpg	Antarctosaurus was a huge quadrupedal herbivore with a long neck and tail. It was possibly armoured. As Antarctosaurus is not known from a complete skeleton and tail lengths are highly variable among sauropods, the true size of these animals is hard to extrapolate.	Argentina, Chile, Uraguay

Aralosaurus	Late Cretaceous	Herbivore	Ornithischia	8	aralosaurus.jpg	Aralosaurus was about the size of an elephant. Although very little is known about Aralosaurus (only one near complete skull has been found); it was identified by a beak with nearly 1,000 small teeth in 30 rows.	Kazakhstan
Archaeoceratops	Early Cretaceous	Herbivore	Ornithischia	1	archaeoceratops.jpg	Archaeoceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were "geographically limited on the landscape", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp beak to bite off the leaves or needles and chop them up to be swallowed.	China
Archaeopteryx	Late Jurassic	Carnivore	Saurischia	0.5	archaeopteryx.jpg	Archaeopteryx lived at the end of the Jurassic period. By the Late Cretaceous, 70 million years later, true birds had evolved.	Germany

Eustreptospondylus	Mid Jurassic	Carnivore	Saurischia	7	eustreptospondylus.jpg	This dinosaur lived in the Callovian stage of the Middle Jurassic period in southern England, at a time when Europe was a series of scattered islands (due to tectonic movement at the time which raised the sea-bed and flooded the lowland). It might have foraged on shorelines for carcasses and marine life.	England, United Kingdom
Fukuiraptor	Early Cretaceous	Carnivore	Saurischia	13	fukuiraptor.jpg	Scientists first thought it was a member of the Dromaeosauridae, but after studying the fossils they then believed it was related to Allosaurus (which is classed in a different family) in the family Neovenatoridae. However, more recently, another analysis has proposed that all megaraptorans are actually tyrannosauroids, which would reclassify Fukuiraptor as a tyrannosauroid coelurosaur.	Japan
Fukuisaurus	Early Cretaceous	Herbivore	Ornithischia	4.7	fukuisaurus.jpg	Fukuisaurus was a genus of herbivorous dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous. It was an ornithopod which lived in what is now Japan.	Japan

Hypacrosaurus	Late Cretaceous	Herbivore	Ornithischia	9	hypacrosaurus.jpg	Hypacrosaurus is most easily distinguished from other hollow-crested duckbills (lambeosaurines) by its tall neural spines and the form of its crest. The neural spines, which project from the top of the vertebrae, are 5 to 7 times the height of the body of their respective vertebrae in the back, which would have given it a tall back in profile. 	Canada, USA
